h1. JFlow Benchmarks

This repository contains several open source flow-based applications written in
Java that we have parallelized.

h2. Getting started with development

All of the projects have corresponding Eclipse projects that can be easily
imported into Eclipse Juno (or later) for development. When coding with Eclipse,
please use the included code formatter (from Eclipse JDT) in the "Coding
conventions" folder. For more information on using the custom code formatter,
refer to this "guide":http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/preferences/java/codestyle/ref-preferences-formatter.htm.
